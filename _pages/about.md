I am a mechatronics engineer and a Ph.D. candidate in Engineering, with a focus on robotics and computer vision. I currently work as a university professor, with experience in teaching, applied research, and the development of solutions in robotic perception, artificial intelligence, and digital image processing.

My work focuses on the design and implementation of deep learning algorithms for tasks such as multimodal perception, multi-object tracking (MOT), 3D environment reconstruction, and sensory data analysis. I have developed solutions based on multi-task learning, recurrent neural networks (LSTM, BiLSTM, xLSTM), sensor fusion, and end-to-end architectures, as well as explored generative techniques such as GANs. These solutions have been applied in projects involving autonomous vehicles, human-machine interaction, immersive systems, augmented reality, and predictive modeling using 3D and genomic data.

I have also supervised undergraduate and masterâ€™s theses, and led academic processes using agile methodologies such as SCRUM, applied to the development of multimedia products and interactive systems. I have experience in the formulation of ICT projects with a focus on sustainability, education, and technological innovation, and I maintain an active interest in emerging trends such as the metaverse, Web 3.0, virtual reality, and the digital economy.
